## How to play
How to play? Download the repository to your computer and run the 'hangman.py'! The game comes with its own included word list. 'words.txt', which contains a list of the useful material or things used in school and university.

## Customization
You want to create or specify your own words? Just overwrite or replace the words from the 'words.txt', with each words on seperated lines. Words with spaces will also work. (Ex: ice cream). Also you can add yor massage as you like: in the line 129 adjust the message to your preference.

## Reference
- The included graphics library, `graphics.py`, was written by John Zelle for use with the book "Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates).
- This program was originally written by Tom Catullo (https://github.com/Tom25/Hangman.git) and modified by me, as an reference code. I did some moddifications to the project and add information to the user and customer.

## Modifications
- Replace the words that came with the original code.
- Let the user know a brief description of the game: relation of the words and how many attempts he has in total.
- When the user or customer enter the worng letter, let the user or customer know the number of fail attempts currently have.
- Fix the happy face when you win and add the sad face when you lose.
- Add when you have finished the attempts or have won the game the text of Game Over or Victory in the description section.
